# Java Tic Tac Toe Game with GUI and Minimax AI

This project is a graphical Tic Tac Toe game built in Java with a user-friendly interface and an unbeatable AI opponent.


## Features

-This Java project is a graphical Tic Tac Toe game implemented with three separate frames using Swing (or your GUI toolkit):
- **Three GUI Frames**:
  - **Home Frame**:
    - The starting screen where the user chooses the game mode:
        * Player vs Player
        - Computer vs Player
  - **Player vs Player Frame**:
    - A game board for two human players to play against each other, taking turns clicking the grid to place their marks (X or O)..
  - **Computer vs Player Frame**:
    - A game board where a human player competes against the computer.
    - The computer uses the **Minimax algorithm** , an AI technique, to make optimal moves, ensuring it never loses.
- **Minimax AI Algorithm**:  
  Minimax is a recursive algorithm used in decision-making and game theory to find the optimal move for a player, assuming the opponent also plays optimally. It explores all possible moves and their outcomes to select the best one.
- **Interactive Gameplay**:  
  Players click to place their marks (X or O), and the game detects wins, draws, and invalid moves.
- **Restart Button:**  
  Allows players to reset the game board anytime and start a new match without restarting the entire application.

## This project is great for understanding

- GUI programming with Java frames and event handling

- Implementation of classic algorithms like Minimax

- Structuring multi-frame applications

- Game development basics with AI integration
## How It Works
- The Home Frame allows you to choose between Player vs Player and Computer vs Player modes.

- In Player vs Player mode, two players alternate placing X‚Äôs and O‚Äôs on the grid.

- In Computer vs Player mode, the computer uses the Minimax algorithm to choose its moves, ensuring the strongest possible play.

- The game recognizes when a player wins or when the game ends in a draw.
